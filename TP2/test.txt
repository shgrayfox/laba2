America’s music culture has been growing and spreading its popularity for many years. The best known American singers are those who sing to the rock beat. Rock revolutionized music in America in the early 1950s and nowadays, shows no sign of slowing down. There isn’t a corner of the globe that hasn’t felt the drive of American rock.
Two other genres of American music have had a strong hold for the past decade. They are rap and hip hop.
